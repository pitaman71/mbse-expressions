# Conformance corpus

Each implementation builds the same corpus, statement for statement (`python3/mbse/Expressions/Conformance/Corpus.py`,
`typescript5/src/Conformance/Corpus.ts`), and commits its snapshots here as `<implementation>/<case>.json` (reachable
snapshot, indent 2) and `<case>.yaml`.

| Case | Covers |
|---|---|
| `expression` | an expression through its tagged meta-schemas: every kind and literal type, a let, shared variables, an extension operation; rebuilt with `Expressions.Builders` |

The CONF test suite in each implementation checks that its own files are current, that the JSON files are
byte-identical across implementations, that every implementation's YAML reads back to the same snapshot (also under a
YAML 1.1 reader), and that every implementation's JSON and YAML deserialize to the same expressions, which validate.

Regenerate:

```sh
(cd python3 && uv run python -m mbse.Expressions.Conformance.write)
(cd typescript5 && npm run conformance)
```
