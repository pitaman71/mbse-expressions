# Domains as data (a proposal, for review)

A domain should be schema-governed data, held in a store like any other model, with only the arithmetic it implies
left as code. Today most domains are plain code objects, and the one form that is data is a copy of them. Asked why
there is a "working" domain beside the stored one, the user agreed there should be none: "Yes, write it up". This
proposes one form of a domain, and asks what only the user can decide. Nothing is built until it is decided.

## Where it stands

Since stage 3 of the port, a domain can be stored: an `Expressions.Framework.Domain`, a reference object holding its
`kind`, a value of the union `Expressions.Framework.DomainKind`, owned by its dialect through
`Expressions.Framework.Defines(dialect, name, domain)` and linked to its scalar schema by `HasDomain`. Only the
Patterns dialect (formerly Basic) defines domain kinds, and only Patterns stores domains.

Everything that uses a domain uses code objects instead:

| Module (Python; TypeScript has the same) | Lines | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| `Framework/Domains.py` | 268 | `Domain` (a protocol: `contains`, `includes`), `Signature`, `OfTypes`, `OfValues`, `OfUnion`, `Anything`, `Function`, `Same`, `Overloaded`, `Opaque`, `Either` |
| `Dialects/Patterns/Domains.py` | 739 | 14 dataclasses (`_Integer`, `_Ieee754`, `_Bits`, `_Bytes`, `_Unicode`, `_Enum`, `_Packed`, ...), the defaults, `SIGNATURES`, and `read`, which turns a stored domain into one of these |
| `Dialects/C/Domains.py` | 319 | `CType`, C's integer and floating types as module constants, promotion and the usual arithmetic conversions, operator signatures |
| `Dialects/SystemVerilog/Domains.py` | 216 | 4-state logic vectors, their widths and signedness |
| `Dialects/{Excel,Matlab,Latex,Python3,TypeScript5}/Domains.py` | 48 to 103 each | each dialect's value domains and operator signatures |

So there are two forms of a Patterns domain, the stored one and the dataclass it is read into, and one form, code only,
of every other dialect's. Operator signatures are code too, though stage 3 modeled every Patterns operation as data, a
`Schemas.OfExpression` whose pattern's variables are its arguments and whose `result` is its return
([API.md](../port/API.md), Settled in stage 3, 20 to 22): the code table `Domains.SIGNATURES` and the stored operations
describe the same thing twice.

Since stage 3 a term carries no domain, so evaluation reads no stored domain at all. The code objects serve the
defaults (an unbounded integer, binary64), C's and SystemVerilog's types, operator signatures and validation of
literals (a value out of range).

How it came to be: stage 3 recorded "what a domain means stays code, as intrinsics' implementations are", the agent's
proposal, never put to the user on its own. In building, "what a domain means" grew to cover the domains themselves.
It cuts against [PRI-018: no model needs code to read or write](https://github.com/pitaman71/mbse-basis/blob/main/docs/PRINCIPLES.md#PRI-018) and the user's "Dialects should be models".

## Decided, that applies

- **Domains are objects, defined by dialects** (2026-10-28; mbse-basis [CAP-226](https://github.com/pitaman71/mbse-basis/blob/main/docs/capabilities/CAP-226.md#decided) and [CAP-097](https://github.com/pitaman71/mbse-basis/blob/main/docs/capabilities/CAP-097.md#decided)):
  "all scalars are domains and users may define domains and dialects containing domains"; "a scalar schema can have >
  1 domain"; "width is a property of the domain, not the schema"; a dialect defines its domains by name, through
  `Expressions.Framework.Defines(dialect, name, domain)`.
- **Dialects are models**: "Dialects should be models"; "each dialect has a singleton by name".
- **Terms carry no domain; inference is a follow-up**: "Terms do not designate their schema. Whatever reference object
  owns the root term must specify its schema." "For the time being, evaluation will need to do without an external
  source specifying the domain for every term, as that involves building a type inference system which should be a
  follow-up capability" ([CAP-232: domains inferred for terms](https://github.com/pitaman71/mbse-basis/blob/main/docs/capabilities/CAP-232.md)).
- **Only intrinsics' implementations are code** (schema extension 9, in [FEA-024](https://github.com/pitaman71/mbse-basis/blob/main/docs/features/FEA-024.md#decided)): "printers and parsers go
  through Visitor just like everything else"; only intrinsics' implementations are code, each found through its named
  reference object.
- **Standing rules**: "Never guess the schema"; no DSL wrapping builder syntax ([PRI-019](https://github.com/pitaman71/mbse-basis/blob/main/docs/PRINCIPLES.md#PRI-019)); concrete references are paths
  ([PRI-015](https://github.com/pitaman71/mbse-basis/blob/main/docs/PRINCIPLES.md#PRI-015)).

## Proposed

One form of a domain: the stored one. Concretely:

1. **Every dialect stores its domains.** Each dialect's install defines its domain kinds by schema extension of
   `DomainKind` (as dialects extend `Term`), and its define writes its domains as `Expressions.Framework.Domain`
   objects, owned by its singleton through `Defines`, by name: Patterns' defaults (`int`, `float`, ...), C's and C++'s
   types (`int`, `unsigned long long`, `size_t`, ...), SystemVerilog's (`logic`, `bit`, sized vectors), Python's,
   TypeScript's, MATLAB's, Excel's and LaTeX's value domains.
2. **What a domain means is its properties, inferred ones included.** As the user decided (2026-11-04), correcting
   this proposal's first draft ("What a domain means becomes functions"): "no. inferred properties are still
   properties. For now they must be hand populated, but eventually they will be computed by constraint resolution."
   A domain stores its parameters (width, signedness, overflow, format, rounding) and the properties that follow from
   them (its least and greatest values, whether it is ordered, the domain a result is fitted into, ...) alike, as
   properties of its kind; the inferred ones are populated by hand in each dialect's define until constraint
   resolution computes them ([CAP-043: constraints resolved in any direction](https://github.com/pitaman71/mbse-basis/blob/main/docs/capabilities/CAP-043.md)). No domain is a class or a function; the
   dataclasses and `read` go. Evaluation's arithmetic (adding two values, rounding a result) is the evaluator's, as
   now, reading the domain's properties.
3. **Operator signatures are the stored operations** (their result domains deferred to CAP-232, Decided, 2). An operation's argument and result schemas say what
   `SIGNATURES` says; the code tables go, and validation and inference read the stored operations. What a rule would
   compute (C's usual arithmetic conversions, "the same domain as its arguments") is, by the same decision, an inferred
   property: the result domain for each combination of argument domains, populated by hand until constraint
   resolution computes it (question 2).
4. **The framework keeps only protocols.** `Domain`, `Signature` and friends become the reading interface over stored
   domains and operations; `Anything` and `Opaque` become stored domains of the framework, or the absence of one
   (question 3).
5. **Validation reads stored domains.** A literal out of range is reported against the domain its dialect stores for
   it, not a code constant.

## Decided, on this proposal

As the user decided (2026-11-04), on the questions below:

- **1. Before domain inference**: "1,5. yes before per your recommendation": domains as data first, as its own
  release; CAP-232 builds on stored domains.
- **3. `Anything` and `Opaque`**: "agreed. Schemas.OfAny kind of handles that": no stored "anything" domain; where
  nothing is known, a result's domain is absent, its value an unrestricted `Schemas.OfAny`.
- **4. Kinds shared per standard**: "proceed with this for now. I will review": Patterns' kinds (two's complement,
  IEEE 754, IEEE 1164, ...) shared, each dialect's domains instances of them under its own names.
- **5. Typing C literals by suffix**: "1,5. yes before per your recommendation": kept, as a lookup of the stored domain
  by the literal's suffix and base.
- **2. Operations' result domains: deferred to CAP-232.** Asked what "code intrinsics" meant (the first draft's word,
  for a rule implemented as a function registered by the operation's name, which "inferred properties are still
  properties" rules out), then shown that the question is the relation from an operation's argument domains to its
  result domain: "I wasn't expecting that to become an issue until CAP-232." Proposed and agreed ("yes"): this
  proposal stores each dialect's domains, their parameters and hand-populated properties, and each operation's
  argument and result schemas as stage 3 has them; the relation from argument domains to result domain, and how it is
  populated, are domain inference's ([CAP-232](https://github.com/pitaman71/mbse-basis/blob/main/docs/capabilities/CAP-232.md)). Until then `Dialect.infer`'s signatures stay as they are, marked as CAP-232's to
  replace, and evaluation's arithmetic (C's usual arithmetic conversions applied to the values it computes) is the
  evaluator's, as now.

## Questions for the user

1. **Order with domain inference (CAP-232).** (a) This first, as its own release: inference then builds on stored
   domains. (b) Together with inference, since much of what reads domains today exists for want of inference.
   *Recommended: (a)*: it is a model change, inference is a capability on top.
2. **How a rule's results are populated by hand.** "The same domain as its arguments" is one property per operation;
   C's usual arithmetic conversions are a result domain per pair of arithmetic types (about a dozen types, so on the
   order of a hundred entries in C, fewer in C++'s overlap). (a) Stored as entries of a relation from an operation and
   its argument domains to its result domain, written in each dialect's define. (b) A smaller rule-shaped model (a
   rank per type and "the higher rank wins"), itself properties. *Recommended: (a)*: it is plain data, and what
   constraint resolution will later compute is exactly those entries.
3. **`Anything` and `Opaque`.** (a) Stored domains of the framework, `Expressions.Framework.Anything`, every
   dialect's result where nothing is known. (b) The absence of a domain, an operation's result left unconstrained.
   *Recommended: (b)*, since a term's domain is already absent where not inferred.
4. **One domain kind per standard concept, shared, or per dialect.** C's `unsigned int` and Patterns' 32-bit unsigned
   integer are the same two's-complement integer. (a) Patterns' `integer` kind, shared, C's domains instances of it
   with C's names. (b) Each dialect its own kinds. *Recommended: (a)*, as [PRI-012: model published standards](https://github.com/pitaman71/mbse-basis/blob/main/docs/PRINCIPLES.md#PRI-012)
   has it: the standard (two's complement, IEEE 754, IEEE 1164) is the kind, the dialect names its instances.
5. **Typing C literals by suffix.** Stage 5 types a C literal by its suffix and base from code tables, before CAP-232
   (an open question from #19's review). With C's types stored, it becomes a lookup of a stored domain by the
   literal's suffix. (a) Keep it, reading stored domains. (b) Defer it to CAP-232. *Recommended: (a)*: it is what the
   old typed constant did, and it is a lookup, not inference.

## Stages (proposed, once decided)

Each passes both gates at 100% in both languages, on every supported Node version, with the corpora regenerated, and a
whole-record review before it is brought to the user.

1. The framework: domain kinds by extension in every dialect, their parameters and inferred properties, the relation
   holding operations' result domains, and the reading interface.
2. Patterns: its domains stored, its dataclasses and `read` gone, `SIGNATURES` replaced by its stored operations.
3. C and Cpp; then SystemVerilog; then Python3, TypeScript5, MATLAB, Excel and LaTeX: each its domains stored.
4. Records in mbse-basis (CAP-097, CAP-232, CAP-226), and release.

## Risks

- **Cost**: stores hold hundreds more objects (every dialect's types), and installs grow; suites build stores often.
- **Equivalence**: the hand-populated properties written once, as data each dialect's define writes in both
  languages, byte-identical on the wire.
- **Hand-populated properties drift**: what today's dataclasses compute (a domain's bounds, a result's domain) is
  written by hand until constraint resolution; the suites pin each against today's behavior, and a property that
  disagrees with its parameters is a constraint a later resolver reports.

## A stopping point for the overhaul

Where the plan stands: mbse-schemas has its 0.26.x fixes; mbse-expressions has stages 2 to 5 of the complete dialects
(the framework, Python3, TypeScript5, C and Cpp) on main, unreleased; stage 6 (SystemVerilog complete) and stage 7
(docs and the 0.8.0 release) remain; then mbse-programs' port, mbse-patterns' re-scoping, and mbse-codegen-python.

Recommended stopping point: **mbse-expressions 0.8.0, released after stage 6**, with #19's open questions settled
(the empty value object in mbse-schemas, C++'s two ways to write a name, the C and Cpp `Pattern` held by nothing, C's
writers) and stages 4 and 5 recorded in mbse-basis. Then pause, and take up this proposal before mbse-programs' port.

Why there:

- **0.8.0 is a coherent release**: every dialect complete over its language, as the user decided, a stable target for
  every dependent. Stopping before stage 6 would release SystemVerilog as a subset, which the user ruled out ("There is
  no reason for an expression dialect to exist that is ia subset").
- **Domains change the model under every dialect.** Doing them before mbse-programs builds on the dialects means
  mbse-programs ports once. Doing them inside the 0.8.0 effort would reopen four merged stages mid-flight.
- **The open defects and decisions are small and known**; settling them before the release keeps 0.8.0 honest
  (no workarounds shipped).
- **It resets the process** the user asked for: smaller stages, more agents, design passes before builds,
  whole-record reviews, at a natural boundary.
